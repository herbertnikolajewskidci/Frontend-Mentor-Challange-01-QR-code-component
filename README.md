## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use QR codes in a web application. I was able to integrate the QR code component into the site and ensure it functioned correctly. I also learned how to style the component to fit the overall aesthetic of the site. This project helped me understand the importance of component-based design and how it can improve the efficiency of a site. I also gained more experience with Semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties, and Flexbox layout.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to continue developing my skills in creating responsive web designs. I want to focus on improving my understanding of CSS Grid and how it can be used in conjunction with Flexbox to create complex layouts. I also plan to explore more about accessibility and how to make my web applications more accessible to all users. Additionally, I want to learn more about performance optimization techniques to make my sites load faster and provide a better user experience.
